# WhiskersProbes
A set of low cost probes for logic analyzers and oscilloscopes.

The logic probe is aiming to be a 500MHz+ Differential buffer to single ended for using a logic analyzer on LVDS signals.

Of note, the matching network on the output is to allow you to match the circuit directly to your logic analyzer input. The values shown in the schematic are the ones needed for HP/Agilent/Keysight if you're using ribbon cables. If you're using a logic analyzer input, the capacitors should not be placed and the resistors should be 0 ohm.

# WhiskersProbes
A set of low cost probes for logic analyzers and oscilloscopes.

The logic probe is aiming to be a 500MHz+ Differential buffer to single ended for using a logic analyzer on LVDS signals.

(current design is limited to 200-300MHz due to part choice)


## Whiskers-AnalogProbe
Coming soon
